# GFLVproteomics
The full analysis pipeline of grapevine fanleaf virus infected N. benthamiana proteins. This analysis is part of a larger project investigating the symptomatic development of inter-veinal chlorosis as previously documented (Osterbaan et al. 2019).


The required files for running the "Protein Analysis 10.20.22.Rmd" file are listed below:

"protein_expdesign.csv", "proteinmatrixcfmfw3.csv", "proteinmatrixfmfw3.csv", "MetadataMatrix.csv"

Having these files in the same folder as the R Markdown file and selecting 'Set working directory' -> 'To Source File Location' will allow you to run the code found within after loading all necessary packages listed within the first code chunk.

Any issues with the code can be resolved by forking this repository or contacting the corresponding author on the manuscript.
